# Terraform templator  

**THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE**  
  
This project aims to create a simple UI for Terraform projects. The scope is limited to simply copying files from a template folder to the project folder and running commands on it.  

## Templates  
The name of the template is the name of the folder it resides in. The template should have a separate **variables.tf** file defined. The program will parse it allow the user to modify it from the UI.
